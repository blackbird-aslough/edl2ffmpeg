# Test Suite Status

## Current State

The comprehensive test suite infrastructure has been successfully implemented and is working correctly. However, tests are currently failing due to configuration issues with the reference renderer.

## What's Working

✅ **Test Infrastructure**
- Catch2 and ApprovalTests frameworks integrated
- Test compilation and linking successful
- Test discovery and execution working

✅ **edl2ffmpeg Renderer**
- Successfully renders test EDL files
- Produces valid output videos
- Performance metrics collected

✅ **Test Utilities**
- VideoComparator: Frame comparison with PSNR metrics
- TestRunner: Executes both renderers
- EDLGenerator: Creates random EDLs for testing
- Test fixtures generated successfully

## Known Issues

⚠️ **Reference Renderer (ftv_toffmpeg)**
- Docker wrapper script fixed for mount point issues
- Reference renderer fails with exit code 4
- Issue: Video file paths need adjustment for Docker container
- The container expects files in different locations than host filesystem

## How to Fix

To make the reference renderer work:

1. **Option 1: Adjust paths in Docker wrapper**
   - Modify the wrapper to map fixture paths correctly
   - Ensure input videos are accessible inside container

2. **Option 2: Use relative paths**
   - Ensure EDLs use paths relative to working directory
   - Mount fixtures directory in consistent location

3. **Option 3: Copy files to container**
   - Copy test videos into container before running
   - Adjust output paths accordingly

## Running Tests (Current State)

```bash
# Tests will run but reference comparison will fail
cd tests
../build/tests/test_integration "[quick]"

# To see detailed output
../build/tests/test_integration "Single clip renders correctly" -v high
```

## Test Results When Working

When the reference renderer is properly configured, tests will:
- Compare frame-by-frame output between implementations
- Report PSNR metrics (>35dB = visually identical)
- Validate effects, clips, seeking, and transitions
- Run property-based tests with random EDLs

## Next Steps

1. Fix Docker path mapping in wrapper script
2. Update test fixtures to use consistent paths
3. Run full test suite to validate implementation
4. Set up CI/CD once tests pass locally
